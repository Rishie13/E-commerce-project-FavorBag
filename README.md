# FavorBag
The E-commerce based web app is a convenient way to help students buy groceries, while collecting valuable “Favor Points” which can be later redeemed in form of discounts at the partnered grocery stores.
Came up with the initial idea of the project.
Worked with Amazon Web Services. Followed agile project management method.
Technologies used: AWS, Bootstrap, PHP, HTML, CSS

Due to university disclosure policy, I am not supposed to put up code or share the website. 
However I did manage to get some screenshots of the project while we were still allowed to. The screenshots include bugs that weren't present when the website was functional.
